# TAS_SS2020

This repository contains our project data for TAS WS 2020/21 at TUM. We build our car simulation in ROS1 and use three different local planners and two generator for navigation. We record navigation data and evaluate the performance of each local planner. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of different planners. Due to data protection, the source code is not uploaded.
